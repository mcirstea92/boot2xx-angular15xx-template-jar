# Spring Boot & Angular template app

This application is a skeleton app, based on SpringBoot 2.7.8 and Angular 15.1.1 at the time **[17th of Feb 23]**

It contains the minimum Spring Security configurations in order to log in with a default admin user and the ability to
secure URLs with OAuth2 JWT tokens.

Further improvements and forks awaited :)

## Usage

The application is built into a standalone JAR file using Maven (specifying the profile: dev/prod). E.g.:

```shell
mvn package -Pprod
```

```
